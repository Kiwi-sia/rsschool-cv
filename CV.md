#### Task:

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.
I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n) returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.
For example:

`nthFibo(4) == 2`
Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.
For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

```C#
public class Fibonacci
{
  public int NthFib(int n)
  {
    int fFirst = 0;
    int fSecond = 1;
    int fNth = 0;
  if (n == 1) {
    return (0);
  } else if (n == 0) {
    return (1);
  } else {
    fNth = fFirst+fSecond;
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++){
      fNth = fFirst + fSecond;
      fFirst = fSecond;
      fSecond = fNth;
    }
    return(fNth);
  }

  }
}
```
